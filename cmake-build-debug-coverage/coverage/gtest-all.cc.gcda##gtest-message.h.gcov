        -:   62://
        -:   63://   1. You stream a bunch of values to a Message object.

        -:   67://      to the ostream.
        -:   68://
        -:   69:// For example;
        -:   70://
        -:   71://   testing::Message foo;
        -:   72://   foo << 1 << " != " << 2;
        -:   73://   std::cout << foo;
        -:   74://
        -:   75:// will print "1 != 2".
        -:   76://
        -:   77:// Message is not intended to be inherited from.  In particular, its
        -:   78:// destructor is not virtual.
        -:   79://
        -:   80:// Note that stringstream behaves differently in gcc and in MSVC.  You
        -:   81:// can stream a NULL char pointer to it in the former, but not in the
        -:   82:// latter (it causes an access violation if you do).  The Message
        -:   83:// class hides this difference by treating a NULL char pointer as
        -:   84:// "(null)".
